        <p>The region to the east of Lisbon is known as the Alentejo packs incredible beauty in a place that few foreigners go to and it is the perfect place for you. </p>

        <p>Accessible from Lisbon by car, this region begins less than an hour from the capital and extends to the boarder with Spain. </p>
        <br>
        <p><em>Why you might ask, well…</em></p>
        <br>
        <p>The countryside of this region varies from the open rolling plains of the south to the granite hills that border Spain in the north-east of the region. This region is the native home to cork trees, as well as olive trees, vineyards, cows, sheep, and pigs, including the Black Iberian pig (or porco preto alentejano). </p>
        <br>
        <p>Let others visit the Douro valley and sip its Porto wine, while you head to the source for some of the best table wines in all of Portugal. Eastern Alentejo is covered in hundreds of distinct quinta, each with its own unique style and, of course, wine. If you and your guests are food lovers and wine aficionados, you cannot go wrong enjoying not just the grapes, but also the decadent cheeses, meats and other dishes that hail from this part of Portugal. </p>
        <br>
        <p>Depending on your wedding size and the location you select, you can house your entire wedding party in one location or have your party scattered over a small area in different guest houses, apartments and quintas. Everyone will be able to enjoy walking through the vineyards, tour organized to other vineyards, cycling trip through the region, relaxing at the spa (even some smaller quintas have their own spas) and relaxing by the pool.</p>
        <br>
        <p>In less than an hour of landing in Lisbon, you will arrive to Alentejo where your relaxing escape of a wedding begins. </p>
        <br>
        <p><em>Now that we have gushed, here are the possible cons, because, what good is our advice if we don’t prepare you for what may be difficult.</em> </p>
        <br>
        <p>This region gets hot! For real hot. Temperatures can reach 40 °C (104 °F) and occasionally even 45 °C (113 °F). It is a dry heat, but an intense one. That said, you are guaranteed to have sun from April to November. </p>
        <br>
        <p>While this is a place for many Portuguese wedding, this region is still fairly new to welcoming foreigner couples. It means that finding all of the vendors that you want that speak perfect English may be difficult. It also means, if you don’t speak Portuguese, you will probably end up relying heavily on the first vendor you encounter with the best English.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Another difficulty is that many local vendors will not have websites and those that do will probably only be in Portugese. Facebook pages, are a bit more common, but then again, they will probably be in Portuguese. One option is to look for wedding planners, photographers, etc. that are based in Lisbon and can easily travel to the region.
